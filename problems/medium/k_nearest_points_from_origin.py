https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
 return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique
 (except for the order that it is in).
